In Java, both Comparable and Comparator are interfaces used to define the order of objects. However, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.
Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two:

Comparable
Definition: The Comparable interface is used to define the natural ordering of objects of a class. A class that implements Comparable must define the compareTo method.

Method:

int compareTo(T o): This method compares the current object with the specified object for order. It returns:
A negative integer if the current object is less than the specified object.
Zero if the current object is equal to the specified object.
A positive integer if the current object is greater than the specified object.
Usage:

You implement Comparable in the class whose objects you want to sort.
It is typically used when you want a default sorting order for the objects of that class.
Comparator
Definition: The Comparator interface is used to define an external ordering of objects. It allows you to create multiple sorting strategies for the same class.

Method:

int compare(T o1, T o2): This method compares two objects for order. It returns:
A negative integer if the first object is less than the second.
Zero if they are equal.
A positive integer if the first object is greater than the second.
Usage:

You create a separate class that implements Comparator or use a lambda expression to define the comparison logic.
It is useful when you want to sort objects in different ways without modifying the class itself.
